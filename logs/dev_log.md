## 2025-05-31 - RtMqDbvJCM2s - Phase 1.1: ESP32 Project Setup & Display Initialization
### Started: 19:20
- Initial state: Empty project directory with init-project.py script
- Approach: Create complete project structure with ESP32 firmware and Python admin console

### Progress:
- 19:25: Created project directory structure using init-project.py
- 19:30: Implemented ESP32 main.cpp with LVGL display initialization
- 19:35: Created lv_conf.h configuration for LVGL
- 19:40: Implemented shared protocol definitions (protocol.h and protocol.py)
- 19:45: Created BLE GATT server implementation (BLEManager)
- 19:50: Implemented WiFi scanner component
- 19:55: Created command processor for handling BLE commands
- 20:00: Implemented Python BLE controller using Bleak
- 20:05: Created dark-themed GUI using customtkinter with shadcn/ui styling
- 20:10: Integrated all components in main.cpp

### Implementation Details:
**ESP32 Firmware Structure:**
- `/mct2032-firmware/src/main.cpp` - Main application with LVGL UI
- `/mct2032-firmware/include/BLEManager.h` - BLE GATT server
- `/mct2032-firmware/include/WiFiScanner.h` - WiFi scanning functionality
- `/mct2032-firmware/include/CommandProcessor.h` - Command routing
- `/mct2032-firmware/include/protocol.h` - Shared protocol definitions

**Python Admin Console Structure:**
- `/mct2032-admin/mct2032_admin/protocol.py` - Protocol implementation
- `/mct2032-admin/mct2032_admin/ble_controller.py` - BLE client using Bleak
- `/mct2032-admin/mct2032_admin/gui.py` - Dark-themed Tkinter GUI
- `/mct2032-admin/main.py` - Application entry point

**Key Features Implemented:**
1. LVGL circular display with dark theme
2. BLE GATT server with 3 characteristics (Command, Data, Status)
3. WiFi scanning with JSON serialization
4. Command processing framework
5. Async BLE communication in Python
6. Dark hacker-themed GUI with purple gradients

### Completed: 20:15
- Final implementation: Complete base project structure with BLE communication
- Tests to run: Compile firmware, test BLE connectivity, verify display output
- Next steps: Phase 1.2 (WiFi Scanner), Phase 1.3 (BLE Setup), Phase 2.1 (Admin Console)
