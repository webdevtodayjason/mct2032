# MCT2032 Working Features Summary

## ‚úÖ Fully Working Features

### 1. **WiFi Scanning**
- Scans all 2.4GHz channels
- Shows SSID, BSSID, channel, RSSI, security type
- Detects hidden networks
- Updates display with scan progress
- Sends results via BLE to admin console

### 2. **BLE Communication**
- Stable connection between device and admin console
- JSON command/response protocol
- Chunked data transfer for large responses
- Real-time status updates

### 3. **Admin Console**
- Dark hacker-themed UI
- WiFi scan results display
- Real-time device status
- Console logging
- Stop scan functionality

### 4. **Display**
- 1.47" circular LCD working perfectly
- LVGL UI with animations
- Status indicators
- Mode display
- Connection status

### 5. **RGB LED**
- Status indication (breathing effects)
- Color coding for different modes:
  - Purple: Idle/Ready
  - Blue: Scanning
  - Green: Connected

### 6. **SD Card** (Partially Working)
- ‚úÖ Card detection and initialization
- ‚úÖ Reading card info (size, free space)
- ‚úÖ Basic file operations work in isolation
- ‚ùå Cannot test via BLE due to stack overflow

## üîß Features Ready But Not Active

### 1. **Packet Monitor**
- Framework implemented
- Promiscuous mode support
- Packet statistics
- Ready to activate

### 2. **Deauth Attack**
- Code structure in place
- Needs activation

### 3. **Beacon Spam**
- Framework ready
- Not yet enabled

## ‚ùå Not Working

### 1. **USB HID/Ducky Scripts**
- Hardware limitation with current board
- Requires different USB configuration
- Would need external hardware or different board

### 2. **SD Card via BLE Commands**
- Works standalone but crashes when accessed via BLE
- Stack overflow issue
- Needs stack size adjustments

## üìä Current Stats

- **Free Heap**: ~122KB (plenty of memory)
- **SD Card**: 29.8GB total, 29.6GB free
- **Stability**: Excellent (except SD+BLE combination)

## üéØ Recommended Focus Areas

1. **Activate Packet Monitoring** - This would be a killer feature
2. **Implement Deauth Capability** - Popular and useful
3. **Add Channel Hopping** - For better scanning
4. **Create Evil Portal** - Captive portal attacks
5. **Enhance WiFi Scanner** - Add more details and filters

## üí° Workarounds

### SD Card Access
Since SD card operations crash when triggered via BLE, consider:
1. Pre-loading payloads at startup
2. Using SD card for logging only (no BLE interaction)
3. Implementing a file browser that doesn't require real-time access

### USB HID
For USB keyboard functionality:
1. Use a different board (recommendations in RECOMMENDED_BOARDS.md)
2. Or focus on network-based attacks instead

## üöÄ Next Steps

Your device is already a powerful WiFi analysis tool. Focus on:
1. WiFi-based features (packet capture, deauth, evil portal)
2. BLE scanning and analysis
3. Network reconnaissance
4. Data visualization in admin console

The SD card works great for storing captures and logs - just can't be accessed via BLE commands without fixing the stack issue.
